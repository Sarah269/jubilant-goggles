# YesStyle KPI and Experimentation

<p>I have chosen www.YesStyle.com, an online retailer that offers a wide selection of beauty, fashion, and lifestyle products from Asia. YesStyle carries a diverse range of Korean, Japanese, and Taiwanese beauty products, which are popular for their effectiveness and affordable price points.</p>

<p>I started shopping at YesStyle because it allows me to purchase the majority of my Korean beauty products from one convenient location. Before, I had to buy from multiple eBay sellers, who often didn't carry the full range of products available. I enjoy shopping on YesStyle because of its wide selection, fast shipping, and competitive prices. The site also introduces me to new products and brands that I may not have discovered elsewhere. Additionally, YesStyle offers mini versions of products, which are a great way to try something new without committing to a full-size purchase.</p>

<p>The factors that encourage me to spend more on YesStyle include discount codes, YS points, and qualifying for free shipping with my order.</p>

## Experiment 1:  Standard Shipping Price Details for US market
**Objective:**  To determine whether changing "Free Standard Shipping with any $49 purchase" text to "Standard Shipping $6 Free with $49 purchase" increases orders less $49 for US visitors.

**Null Hypothesis:** Stating the cost for standard shipping has no impact on the conversion of US visits to orders.

**Alternate Hypothesis:** Stating the cost for standard shipping impacts the conversion of US visits to orders.

**Leading metric:** Number of US visitors that place orders less than $49 after adding shipping cost

**Lagging metric:** Number of packages shipped to the US after adding shipping cost 

**Test cell allocation:** 50%-50%
